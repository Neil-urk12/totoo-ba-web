# Project Linter: [Oxlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxlint)

This project utilizes Oxlint as its primary linter. Oxlint is a powerful, fast linter written in Rust, designed to catch common errors and enforce code style rules efficiently.

# Why Oxlint?

Oxlint was chosen for several key reasons:

Speed: Due to its implementation in Rust, Oxlint offers exceptional performance, significantly reducing linting time in continuous integration (CI) pipelines and local development.

Safety & Reliability: Rust's memory safety features contribute to a robust and reliable linter.

Comprehensive Coverage: It checks for many of the same errors and stylistic issues as traditional JavaScript linters (like ESLint) but often with greater efficiency and fewer configuration steps.

Modern JavaScript Focus: Oxlint is built with a focus on modern JavaScript and TypeScript syntax.
